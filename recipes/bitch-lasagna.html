    <p>Lyrics
        I don't like you T-Series  </p>
        <p>
            Nothing personal, kid
        </p>
        But I must go all out
        Just this once
        Bobs or vegana, whichever will it be?
        Sit the fuck down T-Series I'm here to spill the real tea (uh)
        You tryna dethrone me from spot on number one
        But you India, you lose, so best think you haven't won
        When I'm through with you, we're gonna be completely fuckin' done
        'Cause we only just begun, I review you
        Zero, bye bitch, gone
        So come on T-Series, looking hungry for some drama
        Here, let me serve you bitch lasagna
        Bitch lasagna, bitch lasagna
        T-Series ain't nothing but a bitch, lasagna
        Bitch lasagna, bitch lasagna
        Look at T-Series they just crying for their momma
        Bitch lasagna, bitch lasagna
        T-Series ain't nothing but a bitch, lasagna
        Bitch lasagna, bitch lasagna
        T-Series just wet themselves in their pajamas
        So who the hell is Bob, and why you wanna kiss him? (ew)
        I'm a blue eyes white dragon, while you're just dark magician (oof)
        You got a fifth of the population in your nation but
        I got nine-year-olds of worlds so hold your defecation (oops)
        Motu Patlu, what the fuck is that even supposed to mean?
        Your language sounds like it came from a mumble rap community
        No papa, no papa, yes papa, Johnny
        Now down all of this sugar and let's throw this fucking party with some—
        Bitch lasagna, bitch lasagna
        Look at T-Series they just crying for their momma
        Bitch lasagna, bitch lasagna
        T-Series ain't nothing but a bitch, lasagna
        Bitch lasagna, bitch lasagna
        Look at T-Series they just wetting their pajama
        Bitch lasagna, bitch lasagna
        T-Series ain't nothing but a bitch, lasagna
        You got a population of 1.32 billion
        But most your videos can't seem to hit even a million
        Sub-bot!
        </p>

        
<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<ul>
    <li>10 small meatballs raw or prepared thawed </li>
    <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    <li>½ cup onion finely chopped</li>
    <li>½ cup green bell pepper finely chopped</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons garlic minced</li>
    <li>½ tablespoon paprika</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon basil</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon oregano</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon thyme</li>
    <li>14.5 oz (1 can) tomato sauce</li>
    <li>8 oz (1 can) diced tomatoes</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon sea salt</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon pepper</li>
    <li>10 lasagna noodles</li>
    <li>4 cups beef broth</li>
    <li>½ cup cottage cheese</li>
    <li>1 cup Parmesan cheese shredded</li>
    <li>4 slices fresh mozzarella ball</li>
    <li>    fresh basil for topping</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>

<ol>
    <li>In a large pot over medium high heat, drizzle the olive oil in an thin layer across the bottom. Heat until the olive oil is shimmering. Add the meatballs to the pot and sear on all sides, until browned evenly. It's okay if the meatballs are not cooked through. Remove the meatballs from the pot and set aside.</li>
    <li> Without cleaning the pot, add the onions and saute until tender, about 5 minutes. Then add the green peppers and cook until just browned, another 4-5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Stir in the tomato paste. Cook for 4-5 minutes, until the tomato paste is mixed into the onions and peppers. Deglaze the pot with a splash of apple cider vinegar.</li>
    <li>Add the minced garlic and cook another 2-3 minutes, until the garlic is fragrant. Stir in the paprika, basil, oregano and thyme.</li>
    <li>Pour the tomato sauce and diced tomatoes into the pot. Heat 4-5 minutes until just simmering. Season generously with salt and pepper.</li>
    <li>Break the lasagna noodles into the pot. Stir until the pieces are coated in the tomato sauce. Return the meatballs to the pot. Then pour in the beef broth.</li>
    <li>Bring to a rolling simmer and cook for 15-20 minutes, until the noodles are just al dente.</li>
    <li>When the noodles are al dente, stir in the cottage cheese until it is melty. Continue to cook simmer on medium heat until the noodles are cooked tender, another 15-20 minutes.</li>
    <li>Ladle the soup into individual crocks. Sprinkle an even layer of cheese over the top of the soup. Place two slices of mozzarella (or however many it takes to cover the top of the crock) on top. Broil for 5-10 minutes on the lowest broil setting, until the mozzarella is golden, bubbly and melted.</li>
    <li>Cool the crocks for 15 minutes prior to serving. Garnish the soup with fresh basil leaves and serve with crusty french bread. Enjoy!</li>
